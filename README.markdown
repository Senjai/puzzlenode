## PuzzleNode

This repository is for the upcoming problem solving website that we plan to use
for both providing the community with fun little puzzles, and for a way to
evaluate prospective students for Ruby Mendicant University.

Right now, it is being worked on by Gregory Brown and Jordan Byron, without any
formal way of accepting code contributions.  But similar to our work on
university-web, this project will soon enough accept patches from RMU students
and the general public.  Watch this space if you're interested.

Feel free to use this code under the terms of the GNU Affero GPL v3.0. Keep
track of the [RMU News](http://university.rubymendicant.com/changelog.html) 
if you want to know when we've launched this service.
